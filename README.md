Playing with the Tiled Map Editor

Cool introduction to 2d platform games that we will be working with. I tried to skim through main1 to find where the player sprite is to make it smaller so it can actually fit through the map but I couldn't find it. I also wasn't sure why it picked thea alien sprite I used from my last project as the player sprite.
